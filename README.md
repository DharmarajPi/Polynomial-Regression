**Polynomial Regression â€” Python Implementation**



In simple linear regression algorithm only works when the relationship between the data is linear But suppose if we have non-linear data then Linear regression will not capable to draw a best-fit line, in this case, we can use Polynomial Regression to find out best-fit line. Polynomial Regression is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent(y) and independent variable(x) as nth degree polynomial. The Polynomial Regression equation is given below:



y= b0+b1x1+ b2x12+ b2x13+...... bnx1n
